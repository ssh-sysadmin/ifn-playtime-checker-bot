### Take a look at the spaghetticode that is my first ever discord bot. 
This discord bot queries the BattleMetrics RCON API to gather a player's time played on [Icefuse Networks](https://icefuse.net/)' servers.
This is very lazily made code and is literally in a Just Worksâ„¢ state and has tons of remnants of debugging and testing in it. 
#### I gave Icefuse Networks the option to purchase this bot and all exclusive rights to it for an extremely reasonable price, and notified them that if they did not want to pay, that it would be uploaded publicly to GitHub, so here we are.
